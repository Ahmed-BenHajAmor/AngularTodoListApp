# TodoApp

this is a todo-list management app 
 it is composed mainly of 4 parts (components): 
                             1. div that contains a header text
                             2. Header that contains: input field to add a new task (a task has a deadline date/time)
                                                   -> button (clear all) to delete all tasks (todos)
                             3. Links: two links that navigate between the /tasks route and /done route
                             4. tasks list: this is where we will find all uncompleted tasks if we are visiting the /tasks route and 
                                          the done tasks if we are visiting /done route
