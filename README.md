# TodoApp

this is a todo-list management app 
 it is composed mainly of 4 parts (components): 
1. div that contains a header text

3. Header that contains: input field to add a new task (a task has a deadline date/time)-> button (clear all) to delete all tasks (todos)
   
4. Links: two links that navigate between the /tasks route and /done route
   
5. tasks list: this is where we will find all uncompleted tasks if we are visiting the /tasks route and the done tasks if we are visiting /done route
